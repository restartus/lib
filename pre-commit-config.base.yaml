# For the main source repo with random stuff in it
# tried dockerfilelint but too strict and disabling does not work
# cannot run check-builtin-literals due to foreign python code

# note that we exclude node_modules and _vendor for hugo
# since these are typically third party modules
# cannot run  markdownlint checks for hugo
